# esphome_gvret
GVRET CANbus sniffer which can be used in conjunction with ESPHome. Can be used with CANbus monitoring tool SavvyCAN to remotely monitor CANbus messages by GVRET Network protocol over Wifi.

I used a Olimex ESP32-EVP board for this, this board has already a complete CANbus interface onboard without need for additional components.
